# Security Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Employee Timesheet Management System.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access, can manage users and approve timesheets
- **Employee**: Can manage own timesheets and attendance
- **Manager**: Can view team timesheets (if implemented)

### Security Features

#### 1. CSRF Protection
- All forms include CSRF tokens
- CSRF middleware enabled for web routes
- API routes use Sanctum for stateful authentication

#### 2. Mass Assignment Protection
- Sensitive fields are guarded in models
- Approval fields can only be modified through secure methods
- User roles and permissions are protected

#### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- Middleware-based role checking
- Policy-based authorization
- Granular permissions for different actions

#### 4. Input Validation
- Form request validation
- Database constraints
- XSS protection through Blade templating

#### 5. Session Security
- Secure session configuration
- Session timeout handling
- CSRF token rotation

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Debug routes removed from production
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- Environment-based configuration

### Production Deployment
1. Set `APP_ENV=production`
2. Set `APP_DEBUG=false`
3. Use strong database credentials
4. Enable HTTPS
5. Configure proper file permissions
6. Set up regular backups

### Database Security
- Use prepared statements (Eloquent ORM)
- Input sanitization
- Role-based data access

## Security Headers
The application includes security headers for:
- XSS Protection
- Content Type Options
- Frame Options
- Referrer Policy

## Monitoring
- Log authentication attempts
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track sensitive operations
- Regular security audits

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to the development team immediately.
